### Blackjack
In the Blackjack game, you will play against the computer. The goal is to get a hand with a total value of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it. Follow the prompts to hit or stand during your turn. The computer will then take its turn. The winner is determined based on the final scores.

### Roulette
Roulette is a classic casino game where players place bets on which numbered pocket a ball will land in after the wheel is spun. The game offers various betting options, each with its own payout odds.

### Slot Machine
The Slot Machine game allows you to test your luck. You start with a certain number of tokens and can place bets to spin the reels. If you get matching symbols on the reels, you win tokens. Otherwise, you lose your bet. Keep spinning and see how many tokens you can win!

### Horse Betting
In the Horse Betting game, you can bet on one of the five horses: blue, red, green, orange, or pink. The horses will race in front of you, and if the horse you bet on wins, you will be declared the winner. Choose wisely and enjoy the race!
